## Releases

To release a new version of the module, run the Auto release Github
Action. It will generate new documentation, update the changelogs, and bump the
version based on the labels on the PRs included in the release. It will open a
PR, which should be reviewed and merged.

Once the release prep has been merged to the main branch, run the Publish
module action to tag the release and release it to the Forge.
